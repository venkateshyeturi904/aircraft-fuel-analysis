## Exploratory Data Analysis

Our initial step in this project involved thorough exploratory data analysis. We observed, filtered, and modified the data to prepare it for further analysis and modeling.

## Data Visualization

We used data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset. Visualizing the data helped us better understand the relationships between variables and identify patterns that could lead to fuel efficiency improvements.

## Model Building - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

To uncover the complex dependencies between various features and fuel flow rate, we applied LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a type of recurrent neural network. LSTM is particularly suitable for time-series data and can capture long-term dependencies.

## Fuel Efficiency Optimization

Our primary goal was to reduce fuel consumption. By using LSTM and the insights gained from data analysis, we developed strategies to operate flights in a way that minimizes fuel consumption, contributing to a more sustainable and cost-effective aviation industry.

## Conclusion

This project aims to optimize fuel efficiency in real-time aircraft operations. Through extensive data analysis and the application of LSTM, we've made significant strides in understanding the factors affecting fuel consumption and reducing it. By leveraging the insights obtained in this project, we aim to contribute to more eco-friendly and economical air travel.
